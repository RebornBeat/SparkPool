# SparkPool

---

## Overview

SparkPool is a gas fee sponsorship pool that enables dApps on Sui to subsidize gas fees for new users. It is funded by Liquidity Providers (LPs) who stake SUI, earning premium-based fees in return. The protocol ensures sustainability through a fee-sharing model and is designed for cross-chain expansion to networks like Solana in the future.

## Key Features

1. Gas Fee Sponsorship for dApps

Covers gas fees for eligible users.

dApps must stake into SparkPool to offer this service.

Transactions must have a repayment mechanism (fee system or collateral).



2. LP Staking & Rewards

Users stake SUI into SparkPool, forming a liquidity pool for gas sponsorship.

LPs receive a share of premium fees collected from dApp transactions.



3. Premium-Based Fee System

SparkPool charges a small premium fee on covered transactions.

Fees vary based on network conditions and demand.



4. Collateralized Gas Loans

If a user purchases an NFT or asset, ownership is held in a vault until gas fees are repaid.

A set payback process determines repayment via premium payouts or direct payments.



5. Security & Compliance for dApps

dApps must integrate a fee system or collateralization to ensure SparkPool can recover costs.

Smart contracts validate that transactions meet gas coverage criteria before execution.



6. Wallet-Level Integration

Transactions must be routed through SparkPool before execution.

SparkPool verifies if the dApp and user meet the necessary conditions.



7. Cross-Chain Capability

Future expansion to Solana with a similar Rust-based contract.

Potential support for LayerZero, Wormhole, or Axelar bridging to synchronize staking data across chains.
